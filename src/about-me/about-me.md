    <h1>About me:</h1>

<p>Some recent projects</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JimSchofield/minne"><strong>Minne</strong></a>: A light, signals-based web component framework</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JimSchofield/wc-services"><strong>wc-services</strong></a>: A framework agnostic service provider</li>
    <li><a href="https://potterly.net"><strong>Potterly</strong></a>: a simple pottery journal web app to track your ceramics pieces</li>
</ul>

<strong>In a past life</strong> I was a math teacher, and my students used to affectionately call me "prof schof." I studied html, css, and javascript at night so I could eventually transition to being a front end engineer. That's my profession now. I currently work at Crowdstrike.

<strong>Most recently</strong> I've been diving into web components as solution to programatic dashboards and UI's. I mostly work with framework-level concerns: reactivity, framework agnostic APIs, and microfrontend strategies.

I live in Minnesota with my wife, 6 children, golden doodle, and 2 perfect kitties.

<h2>A note about how I use AI...</h2>

I have <a href="/posts/2025/5/opinion-ai-is-bad-for-us/">very strong and conflicting feelings</a> about AI use in general. I've found in my line of work that using AI to supplement your workflow is necessary. I occasionally use claude-code to brainstorm, to prototype, to vet strategies, and to do mundane tasks that are just a tad too sophistocated for bash scripts.

<div class="decorate">That said, you can be certain that I write every line of text you read on this site.</div>  And I hand-write the code examples that I share. I do not use AI to generate pictures or content.  It's my conviction that we put this sort of boundary around AI use.
