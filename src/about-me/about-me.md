    <h1>About me:</h1>

<p>Some recent projects</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JimSchofield/minne"><strong>Minne</strong></a>: A light, signals-based web component framework</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JimSchofield/wc-services"><strong>wc-services</strong></a>: A framework agnostic service provider</li>
</ul>

In a past life I was a math teacher, and my students used to affectionately call me "prof schof." I studied html, css, and javascript at night so I could eventually transition to being a front end engineer. That's my profession now. I currently work at Crowdstrike.

I've spent the last few years working on content management systems, specifically working with statically generated sites. I've used node, typescript, graphQl, zod, JSONSchema, remark, and Ember (and more!), basically creating a full stack system for documentation authoring and publishing.

Recently I've been diving into web components as solution to programatic dashboards and UI's.

I live in Minnesota with my wife and 6 children and my loveable golden doodle.
