<h1>The Differentiating Property of Web Components</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  About two months ago a Ryan Carniato wrote an inflammatory piece explaining
  that
  <a href="https://dev.to/ryansolid/web-components-are-not-the-future-48bh"
    >Web Components Are Not The Future</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Ryan's piece made the internet rounds, and it seems almost everyone had
  something to say. I appreciate the more measured responses by
  <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/wcs-vs-frameworks/">Lea Verou</a> and
  <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2024/09/28/web-components-are-okay/"
    >Nolan Lawson</a
  >
</p>

<p>
  It made me reflect on the pains and pleasures I've experienced as my team is
  architecting a platform that relies heavily on web components. The whole
  discussion can be reduced down to one fundamental property of web components.
  Whether this property is good or bad largely depends on what you need to
  accomplish, but it is inescapable and has far-reaching consequences.
</p>

<blockquote>Web components are tightly bound to the DOM</blockquote>

<p>So let's dive in.</p>

<h2 id="tightly-bound-to-dom">Web Components are tightly bound to the DOM</h2>

<p>
  Until very recently I had trouble articulating this but it is very much felt
  as you start getting used to using web components. . The post
  <a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/liskovs-gun/"
    >Liskov's gun: The parallel evolution of React and Web Components</a
  >
  gave me some language to talk about this. In the article, Baldur Bjarnason
  says, "Web Components are defined in terms of alterations to the DOM". I make
  an even stronger statement that web components, by design, are tightly bound
  to the DOM.
</p>

<p>
  But to illustrate this, let's rewind and go back to javascript development
  circa 2014. This is when I was first beginning the transition from teacher to
  software engineer. I was bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and manically devouring
  new frameworks like the rest of the javascript world.
</p>

<p>
  But if you can journey back to this era of development, before frameworks
  abstracted a large amount of browser APIs and DOM manipulations, you'd
  remember that "component" design was basically creating a class that
  instantiated itself on a "mounting point," or an element that would contain
  the markup for your component.
</p>

<p>
  This class was a pure Javascript construct. As far as the browser was
  concerned, it could have everything or nothing to do with the DOM. If it was
  dealing with the DOM, it was a small bundle of functions that searched for
  things in the DOM, and would attach listeners and react to inputs. The state
  of the object was stored in this class, and the view, the template, the HTML
  itself carried nearly no state. It was an empty view that remained inert until
  Javascript enabled dynamic functionality. (There were some exceptions to this-
  think media elements or form elements. But by themselves they didn't do too
  much outside of showing media, or making form action requests back to the
  server.)
</p>

<p>
  So to create something like a counter you would provide the smallest units of
  HTML in order that Javascript, like a marionettist, would be able to pull
  strings and create interactions. This
  <span class="decorate">separation of concerns</span> was revered as an ideal
  that front end engineers should asipre to uphold.
</p>

<h3>How about an example?</h3>

<p>To give a concrete example, let's create a counter here!</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>
  That was a lot of fun to do. There's just one glaring omission in my
  example... let me fix that.
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<p>I miss those dollar signs, don't you?</p>

<p>
  Notice that the class could be spun up with any element. Yes, the class is
  expecting particular markup for it to work, but it doesn't require markup to
  actually run. It's a floating class that reaches into the DOM selectively when
  it needs to. The <code>this</code> context in the class is really just the
  class instance.
</p>

<h3>Let's talk a bit about <code>this</code></h3>

<p>
  You'll also probably remember that binding <code>this</code> to event handlers
  was routine and a common concern. The <code>this</code> concern was the stuff
  of tech interviews, and probably rightly so. <code>this</code> could refer to
  the javascript class (if you're in a method or the constructor of the class),
  or the element that is the target of the event (if you're in the scope of an
  event handler function that was triggered) or the window (if you are outside
  of the class.)
</p>

<p>
  This is one thing that frameworks have nearly removed from our purvue: we
  don't have to worry so much about <code>this</code>. Here are some examples in
  different frameworks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In react, there's almost no use using <code>this</code> unless you were
    using the old class component API. If you follow the standard stateless
    functional components,
    <a href="https://playcode.io/2136674"
      ><code>this</code> is just the window</a
    >, or it's <code>undefined</code> if you're using an arrow function. In
    fact, one of the reasons React wanted to move to SFC and not use the old
    <code>Component</code> classes was to remove the component instances that
    React had to instantiate and manage, effectively getting rid of
    <code>this</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Vue, <code>this</code> is pretty useless in practice, because it's by
    default <code>undefined</code> in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags:
    <a
      href="https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9kTFPwzAQhf+KdRNIVRhgKgUJUAcYANGOXqL0SF0c2/KdS6Qo/73nRE07VN3s9753frY7eAmh2CeEOSyoiiawIuQUnrVTqvKOWDVIVNaontSKo3H1DW8N3T5qt7gbE8LKhrEJtmQckmskFlRldK66bhrS9zl3xsIMmOSgX1MXO/JOinR5gobKN8FYjF+BjRTRIIOyk73SWv//MWgcE86OerXF6u+CvqM2axq+IxLGPWqYPC5jjTzay9UntrKezMZvkhX6ivmD5G3KHUfsNbmN1D7jhrbvTfAxP8qali2jo+OlctFM9gOvQX7j7crVT3Xvi4chp10P/QH4lZhh"
      >Check it out</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    It's basically the same in Svelte:
    <a
      href="https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=5.1.13#H4sIAAAAAAAAE23OPQvCMBSF4b8S79RCsXSNseDm7mgcqr3aQLwNyfGL0v8uQcTF9eU5cCaS7sqkacvej-oxRt-rgnsH7kuq6Ow8J9L7ifAK2eVA1Xe1CWGZ7uyR27FL_K-fRgELEmky6RRdQGvFwjNU5mqtdohOLgUGl8qVFVP_mJihaT_npqznhamHprVCFYGfII144_kwvwFfVcJWygAAAA=="
      >Check it out</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    In Ember, reaching into <code>this</code> in the template will get you the
    component the template is related to, or in the case of a route template the
    controller for that route. Ember does the work of binding
    <code>this</code> to the instance involved- so while Ember doesn't get rid
    of this concern completely, it does allow you to think of the component as a
    union of view + controller, so <code>this</code> has been simplified.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>So what about web components?</h3>

<p>
  Let's compare this with how a counter might be written in a vanilla web
  component:
</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>
  What's the big deal? It doesn't look too different from the vanilla counter
  above. And it's true, there's still a lot of wiring up handlers to handle
  events and so on.
</p>

<p>
  But there's a critical difference: <code>this</code> in this component is a
  DOM element. When the browser sees <code>&lt;my-counter&gt;</code> in the DOM,
  it runs our class as a DOM element in DOM lifecycles. The class instance is
  instantiated by the browser when this element is created by HTML. (And here is
  also an important point: there are lifecycle methods now when this instance is
  actually connected to a DOM/Fragment or disconnected.)
</p>

<p>
  We have completely tied our component class to the DOM. We depend on it being
  connected to the DOM to be meaningful.
</p>

<p>There are a lot of really nice advantages to this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The inner template/DOM that your component needs to manage is encapsulated.
    You don't have to worry about what would happen if the html that the class
    is trying to work with is malformed. Generally, the web component makes it's
    own DOM internally.
  </li>
  <li>
    You don't have to manually write the "mounting" logic to make your component
    seek out proper html and mount.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have automatic connected and disconnected hooks that you can use. In
    other words, your component is aware when it's entering the DOM and when
    it's being removed from the DOM. This was a sticky point for vanilla
    components. You used to have to manually tear down listeners and such before
    you removed the component. (At least, I'm not aware of being able to detect
    DOM element removal unless you use a
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver"
      >mutation observer</a
    >)
  </li>
  <li>
    You inherit all methods, properties, etc. from <code>HTMLElement</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is particularly nice for isolated, small, or federated pieces of user
  interface. But this coupling brings about framework problems...
</p>

<h2>Paint point 1: Renderless web components aren't possible</h2>

<p>
  Since web components are tightly bound to the DOM because the component
  <strong>is</strong> an HTML Element,
  <span class="decorate">you can't have renderless components</span>. Sure, you
  can create components that wrap other things and don't affect the DOM of its
  slotted contents, but that's still not renderless. For example:
</p>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<p><code>my-wrapper</code> still very much exists</p>

<img
  src="./my-wrapper-in-dom.png"
  alt="DOM inspector showing my-wrapper element in DOM"
/>

<p>
  <a href="../../8/web-components-and-you-10"
    >As I discussed in a very long-winded post elsewhere</a
  >, accessing live javascript values in memory through the DOM like this is
  perilous and inconvenient. It turns out that the children of the wrapper end
  up with the responsibility of knowing what's in the parent element instance,
  and have to reach out for it manually. And this reaching out, traversing
  upwards through possibly any number of nodes and shadow roots, is awkward to
  say the least.
</p>

<p>
  So while you can create provider components, the idea of a "virtual" component
  is completely missing. If you are going to tie yourself to a DOM element being
  created and then placed in the DOM, you are inherently unable to only create
  an "abstract" component that works behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
  Here is a concrete example of how using a framework allows you to create these
  renderless components to provide functionality without adding any elements to
  the DOM:
  <a
    href="https://play.vuejs.org/#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"
    >in the vue js playground</a
  >.
</p>

<h2>Pain point 2: Web components don't have a "scope"</h2>

<p>
  Along with not having renderless components, you can't expose live javascript
  values to a "scope" for other components to consume.
</p>

<p>
  Take, for example, a react component has a pattern called "render props."
  Because components are "just functions" you can pass non-string-values to and
  fro in the template. This allows for
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control"
    >inversion of control</a
  >. You can have components that pass control up to the consumer using the
  component, and the component can even give the controller specific pieces to
  work with. The classic example would be a list: sometimes you just want
  something to iterate throught a list, but the person using your "list"
  component should be able to determine how the list is actually rendered.
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      // The list maps through the list
      const List = (props) => {
        return (
          <ul>
            {props.listItems.map((item) => {
              return props.renderItem(item);
            })}
          </ul>
        );
      };

      // Then consumers determine how the items are laid out:
      const App = () => {
        return (
          <List
            items={items}
            renderItem={(item) => {
              return (
                <li key={item.id}>
                  I determine the item template! {item.text}
                </li>
              );
            }}
          />
        );
      };
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  At base, the reason that this works is that the JSX you're looking at in the
  return statements for React components <em>aren't the DOM</em>. Those tags are
  a nice way to write out very nested objects. And because this JSX is only a
  blueprint of what should be rendered into the DOM, we have the ability to use
  "just javascript" on any level in that blueprint.
</p>

<p>
  The same thing happens in other frameworks too, even if it's not jsx. Any
  templating language or construct used by frameworks creates a model of what
  the DOM should look like. You are not working with the DOM directly. Because
  of this detached abstraction you can pass objects, functions, classes,
  basically anything that's live javascript anywhere in that template.
</p>

<p>
  So while frameworks have the ability to "scope" values in a template much like
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#function_scope"
    >Javascript functions do</a
  >, web components are islands, instantiated and placed in the DOM with no
  conception of what's above or below them. If a web component wants to provide
  some real live value, it can't be passed like you can in the templates of
  frameworks. Instead, it has to be put as a property on the web component for
  someone to locate and take at run time, kind of like a pie placed on a window
  sill for people to come along and take.
</p>

<h3>But, slots! Right?</h3>

<p>
  Slots are a great feature of the shadow DOM, and yes, this allows limited
  inversion of control.
</p>

<p>
  You'll quickly run into issues trying to implement things the way you're used
  to in frameworks, though. Let's say you want to create a popover, and the
  consumer can provide a button trigger and the content of the popover.
  Something like this:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="html">
  <template>
    <my-popover>
      <button slot="trigger">Open</button>
      <div slot="content">lorem ipsum...</div>
    </my-popover>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  You might already see a few things you wish you could do. For one, you wish
  the text of the trigger could change based on the state of the popover. Also,
  you might want to be provided the handler to attach where you want it
  attached. Something like this... (Totally fake code below, not real markup)
</p>

<code-highlight lang="html">
  <template>
    <my-popover provides="isOpen, toggleClick">
      <button onclick="toggleClick" slot="trigger">
        {isOpen ? "Open" : "Closed" }
      </button>
      <div slot="content">lorem ipsum...</div>
    </my-popover>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  Alas we have to abandon those patterns, because without adopting an
  abstraction that handles a template, I know of no way to create this kind of
  API for a web component with plain HTML.
</p>

<h3>Yeah, but you have attributes, right?</h3>

<p>
  Yep. But attributes can only be strings. We have been spoiled for a decade or
  so with frameworks that never had to rightly differentiate between what an
  attribute is versus a property of an element.
</p>

<aside>
  <p>
    If you are going to deal with web components at any significant level, take
    a look at
    <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2024/attributes-vs-properties/"
      >this definitive guide to attributes vs properties by Jake Archibald.</a
    >
    It is by far the best and most comprehensive guide.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  Basically, if you want to pass anything into a web component via an attribute,
  it must be serialized as a string. Attributes cannot take live javascript
  values. This means that any attempt to create an attribute for a web component
  that inverts control like the react list component above is not possible. (And
  I mean in a sane and safe way. There may be some frankenstein of javascript in
  html that would get this to happen, but I would seriously doubt that any
  attempt is truly a good pattern and/or safe from scripting hacks.)
</p>

<h2>
  Pain point 3: Templating, especially template interpolation, is just not possible yet.
</h2>

<p>
  This is why LitJS exists. It gives us a light framework that gives us the
  templating functionality while melding it with web component's restrictions.
  Because LitJS uses the <code>html</code> helper, you can pass live javascript
  variables to children components. But be aware: this is a framework
  abstraction! This is not vanilla web components.
</p>

<p>
  In an ideal world, we should eventually have some sort of templating construct
  in vanilla HTML. I created a concept stackblitz just to see what that might
  look like to be able to interpolate live javascript data into the contents from a slot. Example
  below, but be warned, this is just a toy demo and is not anywhere near robust
  enough to actually do in the real world:
</p>

<h2>Well, crap.  Should we not use web components then?</h2>

<p>
  Emphatically, <em>web components are powerful and have great use cases</em>
</p>

<p>The reason I write so much about these nuances is to try to clarify why some people are having trouble with web components, not to say that web components are just bad.</p>

<p>We are still figuring out web components, and I think many great solutions will be found and implemented by browsers very soon!</p>

<p>In my experience, here are where web components are especially powerful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building component libraries,</li>
  <li>Creating larger UI pieces that are pretty encapsulated- like a code playground</li>
  <li>Creating presentational components that are re-used often (look at the inspector on reddit for example)</li>
  <li>Needing to publish small parts of UI in a micro-framework-ish way</li>
</ul>

<p>Welp, that's enough for now.</p>
