<h1>Don't Be a Hero</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  I just had a review at my company, and the first "area for improvement" was
  something to this effect: "Jim tends to take criticism personally. He could
  work on not taking things as personally."
</p>

<p>
  "Crap," I thought. I was embarassed. Recently I was becoming more aware of
  this tendancy- or at least, I was starting to recognize I was in denial on
  this subject because it was absolutely accurate and true. My mind went back to
  a few years back when I was describing how I hoped to be an "egoless"
  developer to the very same manager that was reading this new feedback. I
  aspired to be a helper and a teacher, and I wanted to feel comfortable working
  in the background or in someone's shadow.
</p>

<p>
  It's not that I had failed completely. I had actually been partnered with
  another more senior dev for a majority of the things I was doing recently, and
  I was perfectly happy doing so. But I had become more and more touchy when
  people suggested that my ideas weren't a good direction.
</p>

<p>
  Coincidentally, I watched an amazing video
  <a href="https://youtu.be/099cHWSbAL8?si=C-UFFKaDhiHBQWzp"
    >"How to crash an airplane"</a
  >
  by Nickolas Means. I highly recommend watching this, because not only is it
  captivating, it's incredibly inspiring. It reinvigorated the sentiment I felt
  previously when I said I wanted to be "egoless."
</p>

<p>
  This is an essay of sorts in which I try to convince myself that I shouldn't
  try to be a hero. I want to believe that embracing slow is the path to being
  less defensive, more productive, and more enjoyable to work with
</p>

<h2>Success in America</h2>

<p>
  American culture is about prizing the talented, the brilliant, the rich, the
  powerful. Raise up those that in a flash of inspiration create vaccines that
  save millions, deduce paradigm-shifting theories just in their heads, or beat
  all others in a technical market by thinking different.
</p>

<p>
  While all those things are excellent and praiseworthy your regular American
  will also conveniently forget the years of work before said events. It's much
  easier to believe that one person, using their own intellect and unction, and
  taking advantage of maybe a dash of luck, did something great in a moment.
  It's much easier to ignore the setbacks, the imperfections of the
  accomplishment, or the maybe inconvenient truths of the costs of achievement.
</p>

<p>
  So most will assume that you need to emulate this idealistic view of ultimate
  American success: be brave, be daring, take big risks, and the universe will
  line up and reward you with fame and riches. This kind of narrative is rampant
  in the tech and business worlds.
</p>

<h2>Don't be a hero</h2>

<p>
  I was a math teacher for 8 years. I taught students in middle school and
  highschool ranging from the "gifted" to... inconveniently underperforming.
  What I learned from teaching this breadth of students is that truly learning
  material and truly understanding and truly achieving in mathematics did not
  have to do with natrual pattern recognition or IQ. There were students at
  every level of ability that were amazing learners. There were also students at
  every level that were chronically bad at learning.
</p>

<p>
  The students that slowed down, wrote things out, and thought about how they
  approached problems always did best. The students who did their homework
  consistently and on time outperformed their "more brilliant" peers that didn't
  slow down and think slow.
</p>

<p>
  Time and time again, I would ease my students into a new concept, and multiple
  students in each class would say, "Oh, I already know what you're going to
  say, watch this," and would fall flat on their face. I didn't enjoy watching
  this. I spent way to much emotional energy trying to warn students and coach
  them to slow down.
</p>

<p>
  Partly, I explain this because wanting to be a fast, important genius is built
  into us by virtue of living in the capitalism-worshipping, quick-fix-addicted
  America. But also you can explain this partly with psychology. Humans tend to
  jump to conclusions by reducing problems into less complicated ones- often
  leading to incorrect results.<sup><a href="#sup1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
  In my classroom I used to say, "Don't be a hero" so often in my class that I
  thought about making a poster to put up on the wall.
</p>

<p>
  I also said, "When in doubt, write it out" so often, I would use call and
  response and start saying "When in doubt," and my students would complete the
  sentence.
</p>

<p>
  But the thing is, it's a scientific fact<sup><a href="#sup2">2</a></sup
  >: Our brains work in two modes. One is fast and good a fight or flight snap
  decisions. The other is slow, exceedingly more accurate, and deeper. When
  students jumped to conclusions they invariable failed. When they forced
  themselves to slow down they were almost always rewarded with success.
</p>

<p>
  This is what I'd like to bring to my work as problem solver and an engineer at
  my company. I want to avoid "being the hero" that tries to emulate the
  impossible American ideal. I want to avoid taking needless risk and cutting
  corners to try to achieve notariety. <em>I would rather embrace slow</em>.
</p>

<h2>Embracing slow</h2>

<p>
  In my experience the politics of working in software engineering is turbulent.
  There is this major influence and expectation from top level businessy people
  to be "agile," to "disrupt," to "put the customer first," to "hit KPIs," to
  "focus on the MVP." All of these things are said with a wink and a winning
  smile that communicates that they believe in our abilities to pull anything
  out of our hats. Our company is the American hero, the protagonist that will
  figure out solutions in the 11th hour, and we'll get the girl, and live a long
  fulfilled life after we ride into the sunset.
</p>

<p>
  The business side does not like slow, and could care not a little that the MVP
  we've propped up will topple if anyone brushes the table a little too hard
</p>

<p>
  In reality, things get done when I'm working alongside engineers and designers
  and managers that put in consistent, concerted work. It works best when we
  purposefully forget about KPIs. We do our best work when we're not trying to
  make a statement by "disrupting" anything. We want to make good stuff. And the
  most lasting and meaningful projects I've been on have all been slow,
  methodical, careful, and not all that sexy.
</p>

<p>
  Embracing slow brings me down to earth. I don't get caught up with trying to
  impress. I don't worry too much about the source of ideas if they're the right
  ideas. I won't care so much if one of my strategies fails. I won't take things
  quite as personally if people disagree. I won't worry about maintaining my
  image.
</p>

<h2>Accept the cracks</h2>

<p>
  I knew a mechanical engineer a number of years ago that struggled with control
  issues. He was extremely quiet, extremely smart, but it was clear he was type
  A and had trouble settling himself down with things were not ordered the way
  he wanted. One day he shared with me he had an epiphany.
</p>

<p>
  He told me he was in the basement of our church at the time, and he was
  looking at the old concrete bricks that made up the foundation walls of the
  church basement. He noticed a crack running from the very top to the very
  bottom of the wall, and he said, "In that moment, I touched the crack, and I
  realized, it's okay." He said this quietly, in an unerstated, almost
  embarassed way. And it's stuck with me for years.
</p>

<p>
  The lesson here is so simple I feel like it could come out of a taoist
  parable. Even though there was a defect- a crack along the height of this
  wall- it was fine. The wall was fine. The church building was fine.
</p>

<p>
  I want to take the same view of my work, of the politics in my company, of the
  teams I work with. Cracks will always be there. Don't work to control and
  perfect everything. Work slow, don't be a hero.

  A lot of this I'm pulling from "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman.
  I'm using his language when describing this phenomena of slowing down vs
  rapid, more instinctual thinking.
