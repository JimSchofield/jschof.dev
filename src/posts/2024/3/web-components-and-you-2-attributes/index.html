<h1>Web Components and You Part 2: Attributes and Reactivity</h1>

<div class="post-details">

</div>

<p>
  HTML is powerful because it has attributes to customize elements. You can
  specify why type of input by include <code>type="_type_"`</code> inside the
  <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> tag. You can set properties like whether a
  checkbox is checked by using the <code>checked</code> boolean attribute.
</p>

<p>
  So of course custom elements are going to use attributes. They also allow a
  component to react when attributes change.
</p>

<p>First, take a look at accessing a simple attribute "my-attr":</p>

<play-ground>
  <template>
    <my-element
      my-attr="Here is a string passed in using an attribute"
    ></my-element>
    <script>
      class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
          this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });

          this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<p>${this.getAttribute("my-attr")}</p>`;
        }
      }

      customElements.define("my-element", MyElement);
    </script>
  </template>
</play-ground>

<p>
  We can access attributes by using <code>element.getAttributes('attr')</code>,
  and in this example we're just putting it in the DOM.
</p>

<h2>What happens if we change the attribute?</h2>
<p>
  If you open dev tools and manually change the value of the attribute you'll
  see that it doesn't automatically update...
</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="changing-the-attribute-1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>We have to do more work to wire up reactivity.</p>

<p>An important note here...</p>

<aside>
  <p>All attributes on HTML elements have only string values.</p>
  <p>
    If an attribute is supposed to act like a boolean, the attribute has no
    value and is either present or absent
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  If you're used to using <strong>any</strong> framework, this may be something
  you've never had to think about. In HTML, the attributes we use always have a
  string value- which is why weird things happen when you have a checkbox and
  you say <code>disabled="false"</code> and it's disabled.
</p>

<play-ground>
  <template>
    <div>
      <label for="checkbox">
        This bad boy is checked despite checked equalling "false":
      </label>
      <input id="checkbox" type="checkbox" checked="false" />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <label for="text-input">
        This is disabled despite the "false" string:
      </label>
      <input id="text-input" type="text" disabled="false" />
    </div>
  </template>
</play-ground>

<h2>So how do we get a component to react to an attribute changing?</h2>

<p>
  Let's go back to the example above where we take an attribute and simply put
  the attribute value in as text in our component. The first requirement is to
  "register" your attribute with a static property
  <code>observedAttributes</code>. Once you have the attribute registered, you
  can add a method <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> to your component
  class, and that will be called every time an attribute changes.
</p>

<play-ground>
  <template>
    <my-element
      my-attr="Here is a string passed in using an attribute"
    ></my-element>
    <script>
      class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
        static observedAttributes = ["my-attr"];

        connectedCallback() {
          this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
          this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<p>${this.getAttribute("my-attr")}</p>`;
        }

        attributeChangedCallback() {
          // Called when my attributes change!
        }
      }

      customElements.define("my-element", MyElement);
    </script>
  </template>
</play-ground>

<p>
  Now, I'm going to move my template rendering into its own method
  <code>render()</code>. This makes it much easier to re-render the template
  when an attribute changes. I'm also doing a check to see if the name of the
  changed attribute is "my-attr". This isn't strictly necessary, but it's
  showing what you get in this method when attributes do change.
</p>
<p>
  One thing we're doing is also checking if the shadow root has been added yet.
  There are cases where attributes are parsed and the
  <code>attributeChangedCallback</code> is called even before
  <code>connectedCallback</code> is called. So, we just early exit if that's the
  case!
</p>

<p>
  Go ahed, give it a try below! Inspect our element, change the attribute, and
  you should see it update its dom and change!
</p>

<play-ground>
  <template>
    <my-element
      my-attr="Change this attribute and see the web component update!"
    ></my-element>
    <script>
      class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
        static observedAttributes = ["my-attr"];

        connectedCallback() {
          this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
          this.render();
        }

        attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
          if (!this.shadowRoot) {
            return;
          }

          if (name === "my-attr") {
            this.render();
          }
        }

        render() {
          this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<p>${this.getAttribute("my-attr")}</p>`;
        }
      }

      customElements.define("my-element", MyElement);
    </script>
  </template>
</play-ground>

<h2>That was a lot of work!</h2>

<p>
  Yeah, admittedly, that is a lot of work. Web components give us the primitives
  to do this sort of thing, but wouldn't it be nice to just treat these things
  like a framework component? Meaning, is there a a way we can just update data
  and let the template update like in React or Vue or Svelte? The answer's yes!
  In the next post I'll be introducing LitJS and things will get a lot easier!
