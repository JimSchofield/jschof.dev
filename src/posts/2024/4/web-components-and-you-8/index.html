excerpt: "We can create form elements with our new web components, but we need to do a few new things: attach internals, handle focus delegation, and register the component as a bona fide form element with a value.  It's pretty simple once you get into it- let's make a special text component as an example."

<h1>Web Components and You (part 8): Making a form element web component!</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  One thing you may notice while building web components is that once you put a
  form input in the shadow DOM it doesn't get automatically recognized by the
  form it might be in. Also, it doesn't seem to enjoy the priviledges of form
  elements, like <code>:disabled</code> or <code>:valid</code> CSS psuedo
  selectors
</p>

<p>
  Below is an example of what I'm talking about. We would expect that the value
  of the input would be in the formData, but it isn't! There's not even an entry
  with an empty value- the component is not even part of the form's
  consideration.
</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>
  You'll see the form data appended to the DOM as JSON in this example, but
  there's nothing in the form data! Contrast this with a plain old text element
  example below. Here the containing form handles the form element's value and
  adds it to the form data of the form:
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<p>
  So can we have web components as form elements? <strong>Yes!</strong> and it's
  not too difficult to get them set up. In this article I want to discuss:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    How to register a web component as a form element and attach "internals"
  </li>
  <li>How to report values to be included in form data</li>
  <li>How to hook into custom validations with internals</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuring a web component to participate in form stuffs</h2>

<p>
  It's really easy to configure a web component to participate in forms. I think
  the actual way to do this is not documented all that well. Here are the three
  things you need to do to make a web component play nicely with a form and form
  data:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Set a static property <code>formAssociated</code> on the web component class
    and set that property to <code>true</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attach internals using <code>this.attachInternals()</code> in the
    constructor, saving the return value to a property on the class. In my
    examples I do this by instantiating a property directly, but this is just
    shorthand for doing it in the constructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lastly, and the most complicated, you must update the form value manually
    that you want stored in the form data. Here we are looking for an
    <code>input</code> event on the input element and then manually calling
    <code>setFormValue</code> off of our internals property.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  You'll notice that the "key" that this value is saved under in the form data
  is whatever name the component was given with the <code>name</code> attribute.
</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>
  But this may not be enough. At this point, the web component doesn't have a
  <code>value</code> property to set or get the value of the text input!
</p>

<p>
  We should probably have the web component manage some state when the value
  changes in the text input. Here's one way to do this with Lit:
</p>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<p>
  So why did we add the <code>updated()</code> method and update the form values
  there? If we were to update the form values only in the
  <code>setValue()</code> method, any form value changes that were done
  programatically wouldn't update the form! If someone queried this web
  component and set the value, the form wouldn't know. So we set up the form to
  update any time the component updates and <code>value</code> changes.
</p>

<h2>Focus management</h2>

<p>
  Ideally, the form should interact with our web component as a black box. The
  form shouldn't have to reach into the web component to focus the right area.
  You want your text box to be selected if the web component is clicked. For
  example, in the following web component we don't have this. If we click the
  text that is part of the web component (not the label,) it doesn't focus on
  the pertinent input box.
</p>

<p>
  Along with this issue, if we programatically try to focus the web component
  itself, it doesn't automatically focus on the the pertinent input box. Check
  it out by clicking the focus button below:
</p>

{% include "./example5.html" %}

<p>
  This is why <code>delegatesFocus</code> exists. Setting this to be true on a
  custom element allows automatic implementation of <code>focus</code> and
  <code>blur</code> methods for your web component. This is a shadow DOM
  property, so in Lit you need to set this using the
  <code>shadowRootOptions</code> static property:
</p>

{% include "./example6.html" %}

<p>
  Yay! Now the web component acts like a form element. The values are reported
  to the form data, calling <code>focus()</code> or <code>blur()</code> should
  work, and clicking on the component should correctly focus the first focusable
  element.
</p>

<h2>Validity</h2>

<p>
  The component can now also participate in form states like "valid" or
  "invalid"! The easiest way to see this is to manually invalidate the component
  state, and then see that <code>:invalid</code> CSS is triggered:
</p>

{% include "./example7.html" %}

<p>
  If you take away the form associated flag on line 37, you'll notice that the
  component invalidation no longer triggers.
</p>

<p>
  You might also notice that both the web component and the form have the style
  for <code>:invalid</code>. This is because the form validity is dependent on
  the validity of each of its registered components. If your web component is
  invalid, the form overall will be invalid too!
</p>

<p>You can easily make only your component invalid by chaning the style:</p>

{% include "./example8.html" %}

<h2>Form related psuedo-selectors for CSS</h2>

<p>
  We get a lot of other nice psuedo-selectors for free! This includes
  <code>:disabled</code>, <code>:read-only</code>, <code>:required</code>, etc!
</p>

<p>
  Here's an example of a disabled web component with
  <code>:disabled</code> working. Note that we needed to wire up a disabled
  property on the web component to make the text input disabled internally:
</p>

{% include "./example9.html" %}

<h2>We have first-class form web components!</h2>

<p>
  Hopefully that fills in the blanks and will help when making form components.
</p>

<p>
  What do you think? Is there something I missed? Am I just plain wrong? {%
