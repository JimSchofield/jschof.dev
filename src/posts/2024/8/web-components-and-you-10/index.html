<h1>Web Components and You (part 10): Provider Patterns</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  You won't go very far building web components before you realize that
  sometimes components need to be aware of each other. This could be to pass and
  react to state changes, for contextual information, or to send actions or
  execute methods.
</p>

<p>There's a few strategies to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#dom-methods"
      >Using good ol' fashioned DOM methods to find parents</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#events-to-get-providers"
      >Utilizing events to set up a provider pattern</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#context-protocol">Context protocol for web components</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#lit-context">Using <code>context</code> (in this case, lit context!)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dom-methods">Using parents and ancestors directly to communicate</h2>

<p>
  Let's say that you have an input that acts as a text filter for a list. This
  list is a component in the ancestor list of your button. So we have this
  relationship: <code>my-list</code> &gt; <code>my-input</code>
</p>

<p>
  In framework land, we pass functions to children as props, and this is all
  fine and dandy in framework land. In the DOM, though, we can't do this
  declaratively. We can only pass attributes or string values in attributes. So
  how are we to pass functionality?
</p>

<p>
  One option is for the filter list to reach out to its parent explicitly, and
  run a <code>filterByText</code> method that the parent makes available
  publicly. The button can use normal DOM traversal, in this case
  <code>this.parent</code> and just call the method by that reference.
</p>

<p>Here's the contrived example in action:</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>
  In this case, we didn't provide a method. We provided a public property that
  the list would react to. Could we have called a method? Certainly. Check this
  out:
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<p>
  Isn't this nice? These components are nicely composed and work with each other
  by just reaching out to each other through <code>parentElement</code>. And
  yes, they are tightly coupled, but that is expected in this API. We could
  always spend some time using something like
  <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ow">ow</a> to validate components are
  allowed in that control slot.
</p>

<p>
  But there's an issue... what if there are some layers between the the controls
  and the parent provider? We can't just use <code>parentElement</code>
</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>
  Oh noes! how can it break that easily? The answer is that
  <code>parentElement</code> is probably not the best way to find the parent
  provider. There maby be a million divs between these consumers and the
  provider. So what about instead we use <code>closest(parent-selector)</code>?
</p>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<p>Yay! It works again! We've covered the edge cases, right?</p>

<p>
  Nope, sorry. Take a look here where the consumers (the button and input) are
  in an additional layer of shadow DOMs.
</p>

{% include "./example5.html" %}

<p>
  We have another situation where this ain't going to cut it. If we are nested
  in multiple levels of shadow DOMs, <code>closest</code> is not going to
  correctly find our parent provider. The reason is that you need special logic
  to "rise out of" shadow DOMs and keep searching up the DOM tree.
</p>

<p>
  There is a function you can use instead of closest to recursively search back
  up the tree:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function closestThroughShadowDOMs(node, selector) {
        if (!node) {
          return null;
        }

        if (node instanceof ShadowRoot) {
          return closestThroughShadowDOMs(node.host, selector);
        }

        if (node instanceof HTMLElement) {
          if (node.matches(selector)) {
            return node;
          } else {
            return closestThroughShadowDOMs(node.parentNode, selector);
          }
        }

        return closestThroughShadowDOMs(node.parentNode, selector);
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  So <span class="decorate">FINALLY</span> we have something that is somewhat
  robust:
</p>

{% include "./example6.html" %}

<aside class="blue">
  <p>
    You might be thinking, "Jim, this is super contrived. When are we going to
    have shadow DOMs nested in shadow DOMs in slots like this?"
  </p>

  <p>
    And you might be right. This is covering some pretty extreme edge cases. But
    in my experience in the past year and a half of working with web components
    to build libraries and apps, this <strong>does</strong> come up and it comes
    up frequently. This is part of the reason libraries like shoelace have these
    <a
      href="https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/blob/77d7ce5f2fc87121c7f7b0e5e3e09fbdc48f587a/src/internal/tabbable.ts"
      >complex shadow DOM traversal searches like this</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>So I'd say this workaround is actually quite "light!"</p>
</aside>

<p>
  Alright, so that's how we can possibly get a provider. Using DOM methods. It's
  worth looking next at using events instead. It may be a lot nicer!
</p>

<h2 id="events-to-get-providers">Using events to set up a provider pattern</h2>

<p>
  Events can bubble up and pass through shadow DOMs. Why don't we use those
  instead?
</p>

<p>
  Alright, so the idea here is that when a consumer renders, it will emit an
  event that the provider will be listening for. When the provider hears this
  event, they <strong>provide</strong> a reference of themselves to the callback
  that the consumer sent along with the event. So the provider "provides" itself
  to the consumer as a reference. Voila! No DOM searching.
</p>

{% include "./example7.html" %}

<p>
  You might say, why go through all the trouble of storing a reference to
  <code>my-list</code>? Why not have the consumers just emit different events
  for each action they need to do?
</p>

<p>
  This is probably a matter of preference. I like how the consumers are provided
  a reference to <code>my-list</code> and can do any of its public api because
  they have a stored reference.
</p>

<p>Also, this is a leading example that leads us to...</p>

<h2 id="context-protocol">Context protocol for Web Components</h2>

<p>
  This pattern that we just saw is basically how the W3C's Web Components
  Community Group designed the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/webcomponents-cg/community-protocols/blob/main/proposals/context.md"
    >web components context prototcol</a
  >. Context is common thing in other frameworks, so this protocol provides a
  standard for web components to basically have the same thing, but with vanilla
  javascript!
</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    A provider is listening for a 'context-request' event. This event should
    provide a callback in which the provider should call with the provider's
    context as the argument:
    <code-highlight lang="javascript">
      <template>
        <script>
          this.addEventListener("context-request", (event) => {
            // We only want one context provider to respond
            event.stopPropagation();

            // Check to make sure the provider is giving the right context
            if (event.detail.context === "our-context") {
              event.detail.callback(context);
            }
          });
        </script>
      </template>
    </code-highlight>
  </li>
  <li>
    The consumer dispatches an event when it connects to the DOM. In that event,
    a callback function is passed that stores the context on the consumer's
    instance.
    <code-highlight lang="javascript">
      <template>
        <script>
          function connectedCallback() {
            this.dispatchEvent(
              new CustomEvent("context-request", {
                detail: {
                  callback: (context) => {
                    this.context = context;
                  },
                  // the particular context the consumer wants
                  context: contextName,
                },
                bubbles: true,
                composed: true,
              }),
            );
          }
        </script>
      </template>
    </code-highlight>
  </li>

  <p>And then the consumer has a reference to the context!  There are some other details, like if the consumer can subscribe and react to changes, and how to actually type these kinds of things.  But basically, it's doing what we did in the last section.  The consumer requests something in an event, and the provider provides it!</p>
</ol>

<h2 id="lit-context">Using Lit's Context</h2>

<p>Lucky us, Lit provides context to us.  In vanilla javascript, you have to use what's called a <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/data/context/#contextconsumer">context consumer reactive controller</a>.  Here's an example of a provider and consumer using Lit libraries:</p>

{% include "./example8.html" %}

<p>Admittedly, this is a bit weird.  We're using context to basically provide consumers with methods to change the list, when normally context in, for example the React world, is sharing out pure data.  You can store the list data in the context, but that felt a little strange to me, and there is one hiccup: consumers aren't able to update the value of the context directly through the context.</p>

<p>So really this context is an API to work with <code>my-list</code>, which does feel alright, at least to me!</p>

<h2>So there it is!</h2>

<p>It was a long meandering path, but we looked at many ways to provide a context/api to children consumers.  We did it through dom traversal, solved an issue traversing through shadow DOMs, used custom events, and then finally used Lit's Context.</p>

<p>So what do you think? {% socials %}</p>
