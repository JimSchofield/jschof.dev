<h1>Web Components and You (part 9): Handling empty slots</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  You won't go very far building web components until you reach an interesting
  scenario: How do you tell when a slot has stuff in it?
</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>
  Yes, you could say this is the user's fault. They provided both a slot and
  attribute.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle"
    >But can't we be more liberal in what we expect from others</a
  >
  and help guard against these cases?
</p>

<p>
  In order to do that we would need to know if there is content in the slot.
  Basically,
  <span class="decorate"
    >if both are supplied, we should defer to the slot</span
  >
</p>

<h2>The <code>slotchange</code> event</h2>

<p>
  We have a tool from the shadow DOM api:
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSlotElement/slotchange_event"
    >the slotchange event</a
  >. The event is triggered when content is placed in the slot, and when those
  <strong>immediate</strong> nodes in the slot changes. (If you change the
  great-great grandchild nodes of the slot elements, no event fires)
</p>

<p>So let's see this in action!</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<p>
  Check out the console, and you'll see an event logged out, and something
  called <code>assignedNodes()</code> logged as well:
</p>

<img src="slotchange-event.png" />

<p>
  Without doing anything except placing a span in this slot, we see that the
  slotchange event was triggered. The way I think of it is that the following
  happens in order:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The component is constructed</li>
  <li>The component is connected with the DOM</li>
  <li>The span element is rendered inside the "light dom" of our component</li>
  <li>The span is reflected into the slot in the shadow DOM</li>
  <li>The event <code>slotchange</code> is triggered</li>
</ol>

<p>
  I can't <em>promise</em> this is what's happening under the hood, but it makes
  a pretty dang good mental model. And it also "explains" why the slotchange
  fires even though we haven't dynamically changed anything.
</p>

<p>
  The other cool thing here is that the "assigned nodes" are basically all the o
  nodes reflected into that slot. So, it's easy enough for us to check what we
  need in that slot!
</p>

<h2>So how do we "check" the contents and adjust?</h2>

<p>
  The strategy is straightforward once you know how to inspect that slot. We're
  going to make a reactive state property <code>hasLabelContents</code>, and if
  there's stuff in the slot we record it in that state. Then, we render out what
  we need to with logic pertaining to that state.
</p>

<p>Here we go!</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>
  There we have it. The component checks the slot, toggles a state property, and
  you can decide what to render from there
</p>

<h2>But there are some gotchas...</h2>

<p>
  Unfortunately, you can't do slots conditionally. Say, for example, you wanted to
  show a slot only if there are items in that slot. Well, you enter a kind of
  catch 22 there. If the slot is not on the DOM the slotchange won't happen. But
  even if you try to default showing the slot to trigger the event to not show
  the slot, you'll see that it doesn't work:
</p>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<p>
  You might think that the second instance would render the slot, the slotchange
  event would trigger, the slot would appear empty, and then the alternate value
  of the ternary would show. Sadly, this just isn't the case. In the second
  instance the slotchange event never fires. And I think this is because there
  is never content reflected into the slot.
</p>

<p>
  There's a workaround, but I don't recommend it. If you use
  <code>firstUpdated</code> and check the slot contents in that lifecycle
  method, you can correctly render what you want with a ternary, but
  <span class="decorate">only on the first render.</span> If state changes or a
  slot gets added, it may or may not update correctly depending on the
  situation.
</p>

{% include "./example5.html" %}

<h2>That's all for now!</h2>

<p>
  Hopefully that helps answer how to detect when a slot is empty. {% socials %}
