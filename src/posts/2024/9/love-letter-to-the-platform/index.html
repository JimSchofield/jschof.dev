<h1>Web components + anchor positioning + popover API = I love the platform</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  I want to make a simple popover web component that let's you define an anchor
  and attach a popover to that anchor. This element should handle some simple
  things, like an open attribute and clickout/focusout behavior.
</p>

<p>
  This used to be super tricky, and you'd have to rely on some libraries to get
  this all to work together. (I used
  <a href="https://floating-ui.com/">floating UI</a> which is excellent, but we
  have something even better now that isn't JS!)
</p>

<p>
  Just a heads up... we're going to be using some features that won't be
  available sometimes in chrome or firefox. It's bad that I have to preface
  this, but these are just too good not to make example with, and I'm certain
  these will have global adoption soon.
</p>

<p>Here is the most recent availabilty status according to MDN:</p>

<baseline-status featureId="anchor-positioning"></baseline-status>

<br />

<baseline-status featureId="popover"></baseline-status>

<aside class="blue">
  <p>
    Aren't those API things neat? It's a web component that shows status for
    different browsers that you might have seen on MDN.

<h2 id="popover-api">First Awesome Thing: Popover API</h2>

<p>
  The
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API"
    >popover API</a
  >
  gives us a nice way to make a <strong>popover.</strong> What is a popover?
  It's anything that floats over the page- a menu, a help tooltip- it could be
  anything that isn't part of the normal flow of the page.
</p>

<p>Check out this absolutely simple example:</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>Pretty simple. And notice: There was no javascript (‚ÅâÔ∏è)</p>

<p>
  That's right, just using attributes you have a fully functioning popover. This
  version is more like a modal. If you click outside of the popover it closes
  the popover. If you hit escape it also closes the modal.
</p>

<p>
  It actually takes the element that has the <code>popover</code> attribute and
  puts it in a type of "portal" or slot called "top-layer":
</p>

<img src="top-layer.png" alt="DOM showing top-layer slot" />

<p>
  This allows popovers to escape any issues with
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context"
    >stacking contexts</a
  >. This is a pretty advanced CSS concept, but if you're interested or running
  into z-index issues check out
  <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/"
    >Josh Comeau's excellent post</a
  >!
</p>

<p>
  There are two css properties you should know about:
  <code>::backdrop</code> and <code>:popover-open</code>
</p>

<h3 id="backdrop-psuedo-element">The <code>::backdrop</code> Psuedo-element</h3>

<p>
  This selector has a double colon to distinguish this thing as a psuedo element
  you can style. If you inspect the DOM, you'll see the element and can inspect
  its styles:
</p>

<img src="backdrop-in-dom.png" alt="DOM showing" />

<p>
  So let's make that backdrop have a cool, foggy glass effect just to see what
  I'm talking about:
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<h3 id="popover-open-state">The <code>:popover-open</code> CSS State</h3>

<p>
  Often we want to specify styles based on whether the popover is open or not or
  transitioning. So this is why we have <code>:popover-open</code>. To
  demonstrate, here is a fade in/fade out example using that state
</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>
  The reason we need to set display is that by default when a popover is closed
  it's set to <code>display: none;</code>. In this case we're just going to
  transition opacity with a teensy bit of scale to make a nice pop in/out
  effect. We transition <code>visibility</code> to make sure that the popover is
  not clickable or visible by screen readers while it's hidden.
</p>

<p>
  Already, this is super cool. But there's something pretty fantastic that's
  recently made available in chrome...
</p>

<h2 id="anchor-positioning">
  Second Amazing Thing: Adding in Anchor Positioning
</h2>

<p>
  This is fine and dandy if we want our popover to show up in the middle of the
  viewport like a modal. But this is not what I want. I want the popover to be
  <strong>anchored</strong> to the trigger button. In my case, I'm going to want
  to put the popover aligned to the button's left edge and just below the button
  so it drops down like a ... drop down.
</p>

<p>
  We used to have to do this using <code>position</code>, creating a relative
  ancestor and absolutely positioning the popover, using some fancy calculated
  <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> properties. Now we have something
  better!
</p>

<aside class="blue">
  <p>
    Sorry, this only works in Chrome üò≠ but I expect this to have general
    support very quickly!
  </p>
</aside>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<p>
  The CSS is so quick and easy to position to the top and left of the popover
  against the anchor. If you're interested in seeing more examples and how this
  anchoring works,
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using"
    >check out this MDN guide</a
  >!
</p>

<h2 id="web-component">
  Awesome Thing Three: Let's wrap this up in a web component!
</h2>

<p>
  The coolest thing about all this is that we can encapsulate this popover into
  a web component! This makes it easy to reuse.
</p>

{% include "./example5.html" %}

<p>
  There we have it. We've only the platform to make a custom element that
  handles this popover for us (well, using Lit to help smooth out the custom
  element part.)
</p>

<p>
  But we should support a few things: an <code>open</code> attribute, and
  probably a focusout handling to make sure that if you're tabbing away it
  closes. So first: the <code>open</code> attribute!
</p>

{% include "./example6.html" %}

<p>
  To make the <code>open</code> attribute available, we make it a property that
  is <code>Boolean</code> type and reflected. That way, when the attribute is
  changed, Lit takes care of placing the attribute on the custom element in the
  DOM
</p>

<p>
  In our case, we listen for a
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API#interfaces"
    >toggle event</a
  >. This way the <code>open</code> attribute will always reflect the true state
  of the toggled popover.
</p>

<p>
  To make the component react to that <code>open</code> attribute being
  removed/added, we need to create a <code>updated()</code> check to check and
  see if the <code>open</code> attribute has changed, and to imperatively open
  or close the popover if needed.
</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="./popover-two-way-binding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h3 id="handling-focusout">One last thing: handling close on focusout!</h3>

<p>
  We need to have the component respond to when focus is being applied
  elsewhere. "Wait a minute, doesn't it already handle click-outs?" you might be
  thinking. And this is true, but if you were to navigate <em>past</em> the
  popover programatically, or with a keyboard using tab, it would remain open.
  So let's just have the component react to the
  <a href=""><code>focusout</code> event</a>
</p>

<p>
  This focusout event has a <code>relatedTarget</code> property that tells us
  what is receiving the new focus. We can just check to see if that element is
  inside the DOM of the custom element, and if not we can close the popover. And
  vice versa!
</p>

<p>
  Check out an example where we haven't yet done this foucusout handling. Try
  navigating with the keyboard, hitting enter on other buttons, and see if the
  popover closes
</p>

{% include "./example7.html" %}

<p>Alright, so here is an example with that being handled:</p>

{% include "./example8.html" %}

<h3 id="dealing-with-fouc">A small addition: dealing with FOUC</h3>

<p>
  If you are keen-eyed, you might have noticed that there's a split second where
  the popover we made is "popping" in. The DOM shows slot content while the web
  component is still being register, then it applies the constructed styles and
  popover hide/showing a second later. We'd rather not have the slot content
  appear at all until the web component is loaded!
</p>

<p>This <strong>Flash Of Unstyled Content</strong> is easy to avoid:</p>

{% include "./example9.html" %}

<p>
  Note that this is defined in the overall page styles, not the
  <code>my-popover</code> constructed stylesheet. This tells the page how to
  deal with our popover slot contents until it is <code>:defined</code>. Check
  out the <code>:defined</code> <a href="">psuedo-selector docs page</a> for
  more uses. But this is so cool to me that the platform has solutions for those
  edge issues.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: The Platform Is Amazing</h2>

<p>
  I think this example is powerful because it shows just how far the platform
  has come.
</p>

<p>
  The popover takes care of creating a portal of sorts to place content in a
  popover in the root of the document. This popover also handles clickout
  behavior, open/closed state, and creating the opening/closing behavior. It
  comes with a sneezeguard built in!
</p>

<p>
  The anchor positioning allows us to avoid using a JS library and with three
  lines of code position the popover declaratively where we want it. We didn't
  even get into the robust options the anchor positioning css allows for us!
</p>

<p>
  The web component allows us to create a dead simple re-usable element. We
  could modify this to be a tooltip, a drop down menu, or a hover contextual
  helper, and lots more. We use platform events to handle the two-way binding of
  the <code>open</code> attribute and to handle focusout events.
</p>

<p>I ‚ù§Ô∏è the platform!</p>

<p>
  ‚û°Ô∏è <a href="https://piaille.fr/@tbroyer/113323176222102945">Thomas Broyer</a>
  pointed out on mastodon that we don't need to use
  <code>connectedCallback()</code> and <code>disconnectedCallback()</code> to
  attach and remove the focus event listener. It suffices to just attach the
  focus listener in the constructor, since the listener is on the element and if
  the element is removed so will the listener. The last example was updated to
  show that! Thanks, Thomas Broyer!

  pointed out two things:

<blockquote>
  <p>@oldcoyote Looking good!</p>

  <p>
    ...except, the &lt;baseline-status&gt; adjusts for `prefers-color-scheme:
    dark` while your site doesn't leaving some users with the attached screen
    shot üò±
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, have thought about distribution of :not(:defined) styles to prevent a
    little FOUC in your &lt;my-popover&gt; element, something like:
  </p>

  <code-highlight lang="css">
    <template>
      <style>
        my-popover:not(:defined) [slot="popover-content"] {
          display: none;
        }
      </style>
    </template>
  </code-highlight>

  <p>
    Depends on usage whether it's worth having, especially without a standard
    distribution mechanism.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Very true and very true. I've adjusted my site styles to handle the
  <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark</code>. I added a short note about the FOUC
  style at the end of the post, too. Thanks, westbrook!
