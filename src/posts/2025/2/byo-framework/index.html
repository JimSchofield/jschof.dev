<h1>BYOF: Build Your Own Framework</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  The platform is getting so good. You may remember when I gushed over how
  <a href="/posts/2024/9/love-letter-to-the-platform"
    >it's now easy to make a dropdown web component</a
  >. We're
  <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals"
    >hopefully getting signals natively</a
  >. And someday we
  <a
    href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/DOM-Parts.md"
    >might get declarative HTML rendering</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  But the native features avilable to us <em>today</em> nearly cover all we need
  to make a component framework ourself! To build your own component
  system/framework you need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way to mount a component and run a component lifecycle</li>
  <li>A declarative rendering system (like a template)</li>
  <li>A way to react to state changes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Let's try assembling something and see how close to the metal and simple we
  can be...
</p>

<h2>But hhwhy?</h2>

<p>...you may ask.</p>

<p>
  And I get it. We have super nice things in web components already. We can use
  Lit and get everything we need. We could build in vue, or svelte, or preact
  and just compile to web components.
</p>

<p>
  But this comes from an interesting place. While I was writing
  <a href="/posts/2025/1/global-state-with-web-components/">a post on stores</a
  >, I found that I was getting into some framework concerns like declarative
  templating and reactivity. Instead of pulling in Lit, I was creating super
  simple components in those cases to keep things simple, and it I found it
  really wasn't hard to accomodate. The same happened when I was working on
  <a href="/posts/2025/2/the-case-for-services/">an article with services</a>.
</p>

<p>
  It turns out it's not hard to find the right utilities and platform abilities
  to get what you need done, done. I think it shows you why frameworks are the
  way they are- why things like signals and react hooks function the way they
  do.
</p>

<p>Also, it's just a fun exercise. (At least, I think it is.)</p>

<p>
  So let's restrict ourselves to vanilla js modules in the browser, and try to
  stick to super simple primitives that do one thing and do it super well, and
  let's see what we can do.
</p>

<h2>Let's handle the component lifecycle part</h2>

<p>
  This is the easiest. For this example we're just going to use web components
  and their lifecycles: <code>constructor</code>,<code> connectedCallback</code
  >, <code>disconnectedCallback</code>
</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>Simple enough.</p>

<p>
  One thing to note: rendering should happen on the
  <code>connectedCallback</code> phase of your component's life. Why? Well,
  there are certain things that you can't do in the constructor according to
  spec. When the constructor runs you can in practice make the DOM for your
  component, and calling the element in the HTML will not error. BUT, if you
  ever need to construct an element and imperatively manipulate it and place it
  in the DOM, the browser enforces
  <a
    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-element-conformance"
    >"no children or attributes" being made in the constructor</a
  >
  when you try to create an element with <code>document.createElement()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The exception to this is adding children inside a shadow root... but probably
  still not great practice. Beacuse, even if we forgot about the spec, your
  component won't have access to some functionality because it's not yet
  connected to the DOM. For example, you can't dispatch events on a document
  fragment that isn't attached to the DOM. Or, you can, but you won't get the
  results you'd like. Until it's connected do the document, global things like
  styles might not affect your component template. You wouldn't be able to get
  accurate style calculations with <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code>. You
  might have unexpected slot content issues.
</p>

<p>
  It's a finer point, but TLDR let's just render in connectedCallback, agreed?
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<h2>Now for a rendering <em>strategy</em></h2>

<p>The next part answers the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  How should we render <em>and update</em> DOM, event handlers, atttributes,
  etc., when state changes?
</blockquote>

<p>
  If you trust yourself enough, and say you've lived through the jQuery years
  and actually didn't like switching to React back in the day, you might be able
  to make DOM parts, put them in the DOM as needed, handle template changes,
  handle setting up and tearing down handlers, and still have a smile on your
  face at the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
  If that's you, I'm happy for you, and you don't need to read the rest of this
  article because native imperative web components are what we have already and
  it sounds like they are already probably your jam.
</p>

<p>
  In my humble opinion, I would say that it's better for developer's mental
  health and overall wellbeing to use a library like
  <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/">lit-html</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperhtml">hyperhtml</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml">lighterhtml</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml">uhtml</a>, or any other
  number of templating libraries out there. I tend to lean into the tagged
  template strategy instead of say JSX because I don't need any special build
  process that magically turns my templates into javascript. I like that the
  tagged template approach is completely runtime and just as nice to work with
  as JSX.
</p>

<p>
  In the future, we should be able to enjoy something similar and native, like
  <a
    href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/159b1600bab02fe9cd794825440a98537d53b389/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md"
    >Template Instantiation</a
  >
  or
  <a
    href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/DOM-Parts.md"
    >DOM parts</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  We're going to use <code>lighterhtml</code> because it allows us declaratively
  interpolate values, attach DOM event listeners, and update the rendering
  surgically. We don't have to go in ourselves to find what part has changed and
  imperatively change those parts- the template renderer smartly diffs the DOM
  and does it for us.
</p>

<p>So this is what that could look like...</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>
  We've pulled our template out and made a <code>render()</code> function. Then,
  in <code>connectedCallback</code> we use the lighterhtml render funtion to
  attach the template to <code>this</code>, the host component. Want to do that
  with a shadow DOM? Easy!
</p>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<p>
  This takes care interpolating values, and adding event listeners. (In this
  case, to make a click event, you would bind the event listener to the
  <code>onclick</code> attributes. The details are particular to the rendering
  library- ours being lighterhtml).
</p>

<p>What if we want to react to state changes?</p>

<p>
  It's just a little more work here- we need to create an "update" function that
  can be called to render the template every time there is a change. Here's one
  way to wire that up:
</p>

{% include "./example5.html" %}

<p>
  It still blows my mind that this library keeps a reference to the rendered DOM
  and only changes what needs to be changed.
</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="./surgical-dom-changes.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>
  This example demonstrates template rendering, adding event listeners, methods,
  and properties that work together inside the component, and how to ask for a
  rerender when the component state is changed. We don't have to be specific
  about what changed, we can just call <code>this.update()</code> and the
  renderer will take care of smart updates. This is the goal with delarative
  components.
</p>

<p>
  The downside? We have to let the component know when state has changed.
  Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to do that?
</p>

<h2>The final piece: reactivity</h2>

<p>
  A quick and dirty way to do this might include class setters and getters to
  trigger state updates when the setter is called
</p>

{% include "./example6.html" %}

<p>
  Now, instead of triggering renders in <code>toggleState</code>, the component
  triggers update when the actual state is changing. This makes it nicer for the
  user of this component to not have to worry about when to trigger updates, but
  adding all those lines for one state change is annoying for a developer to do
  for each reactive thing.
</p>

<p>
  Another way which requires more understanding of javascript fundamentals and
  more work to set up, is to create a function that sets up those setters and
  getters for the user on the object. For example:
</p>

{% include "./example7.html" %}

<p>
  That works fine! You could have this property "setter" utility handy to make
  it easier to create reactive properties when the need arises. But something
  still doesn't feel great. It's not super clear that the resulting property
  exists on the component. You'll see this pretty quick if you're using TS,
  because you'll have to make a <code>declare state: boolean</code> property on
  the class to make Typescript trust you that this property exists. And the
  utility function we use is annoying to have to include on every component.
</p>

<p>We could use a Proxy...</p>

<p>{% include "./example8.html" %}</p>

<p>
  And it works... but we're starting to get real complicated here, and this
  proxy needs you to pass the update function to call on every state change. I'm
  not sure this implementation is making our life easier.
</p>

<p>
  How about we use something already made, like
  <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/">preact signals</a>? They are
  agnostic enough for us not to worry about depending on preact. They have the
  same niceties that our proxy example had, but signals are actually a much
  nicer experience. Plus,
  <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals"
    >signals may be native eventually</a
  >. So why not pull this kind of primitive in?
</p>

<p>Here's how I would use it</p>

<p>{% include "./example9.html" %}</p>

<p>
  Nice. We now have a way for users to make a reactive state. They have the
  flexibility to put it outside a component, inside a component, or in a module-
  anywhere, really. And the signals should handle the selective reactivity for
  us.
</p>

<aside>
  <p>
    Just a friendly reminder: that signal subscription by using
    <code>effect(...)</code> does need to be cleaned up. Otherwise you'll get a
    memory leak. The solution is to run
    <a
      href="https://github.com/preactjs/signals/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#effectfn"
      >the dispose callback</a
    >
    returned from <code>effect(...)</code> in the
    <code>disconnectedCallback</code>, but I'm going to be that math teacher who
    says "this is an exercise left to the reader."
  </p>
</aside>

<h2>Tying it all together</h2>

<p>
  As you probably know, I'm a huge fan of Lit. I think it is the most tried and
  true bulletproof framework for web components we have.
</p>

<p>But I have a few issues still with it.</p>

<p>
  I've never been a huge fan of decorators because of the paradigm they
  introduce and the discrepancies between implementations between babel,
  typescript, and native browsers. So I wanted to avoid them. In Lit, you kind
  of sign up to use them- at least, the best experience is if you use typescript
  and use the decorators. Alternatively, you can do everything in lit using
  static configurations in vanilla javascript, but I wanted to avoid those too
  if I could and make everything as concise and simple as possible.
</p>

<p>
  So I made a mini-framework for components called
  <a href="https://github.com/JimSchofield/minne">minne</a>
</p>

<gh-repo-card name="jimschofield/minne"></gh-repo-card>

<p>
  For the most part it's based off of the strategy we walked through in this
  post: we use lighterhtml and preact signals in web components to make our
  lives easy. But it also goes well past that and handles some other things for
  web components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    It handles attribute changes and reactivity. It can reflect values back to the DOM as well
  </li>
  <li>
    It has a simple parse/serialize function to help with attributes that parse
    to non-string things
  </li>
  <li>It applies styles in shadow DOM or adds them to the global stylesheet</li>
  <li>
    It provides destroyers for functionality you need to have happen at
    component teardown
  </li>
  <li>
    It even is playing around with being able to use Functional Components.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>
  They say that creativity comes not from full freedom, but from working inside
  of restrictions. This is what I found when I tried to keep my web component
  demonstrations as vanilla and simple as possible. It was cool to see how much
  we can do by assembling the component, template, and reactivity ourselves.
</p>

<p>
  Hopefully this has been fun and inspires some creativity and scrappiness
  in your coding. Let me know what you think. {% socials %}
