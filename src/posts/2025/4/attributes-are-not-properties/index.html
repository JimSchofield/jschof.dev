<h1>Element Attributes Are Not Element Properties</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  Something that has come up a number of times as people are stepping away from
  their javascript frameworks and leaping into web components is that they don't
  know the difference between attributes and properties. This matters because
  there's a <em>big difference</em> between the two, and you need to know when
  to use either or both with your custom elements.
</p>

<p>Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>Element Attributes</h2>

<p>
  An attribute are those things in html that allow us to attach key-value
  information to elements:
</p>

<code-highlight>
  <template>
    <my-custom-element attribute="value"></my-custom-element>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  These are in HTML, XML, and XHTML. In all those cases, the values are only
  ever strings.
</p>

<p>
  The one exception to this is in HTML where you can have an attribute without a
  value, in which the value is just an empty string <code>""</code> if you were
  to retrieve it in javascript. These are generally considered for boolean
  states like <code>disabled</code> or <code>hidden</code>.
</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<aside>
  <p>
    In the example above, it's perfectly legal to remove <code>=""</code> from
    the attribute and have no value assignment. The attr value will still be an
    empty string, and will be considered a "boolean" attribute. (It's either
    there or it isn't.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The reason there's a <code>=""</code> in the example above is that I use
    <code>innerHTML</code> in the play-ground custom element code to serialize
    the markup from the example, and it automatically adds an empty string to
    attributes with no value. Seems like this is just a weird quirk with
    <code>innerHTML</code>.
  </p>
</aside>

<h2>Element Properties</h2>

<p>
  Properties have a special meaning for Elements. When you inspect the DOM in
  the browser, and inspect a particular node, you have an
  <code>Element</code> in hand. That <code>Element</code> is an object (in
  particular, an Element instance object) and can have its own properties.
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<p>
  Take a look- if you select that custom element in the DOM, it will have that
  property. You may not see it right away, because if you log the node or use
  <code>$0</code> in Chrome it will not print the object, but the node
  representation:
</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="./attr-vs-property.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>
  So, properties are plain ol' javascript properties, just in this case we more
  concisely call this a <em>field</em> becuase it's defined on the class
  explicitly.
</p>

<h2>Why the confusion?</h2>

<p>
  I have opinions about how we came to this mess where people confuse the two. I
  had to spend a while diving into attributes and properties while first
  learning Lit. I'm convinced it has to do with how frameworks use templates.
</p>

<p>
  Take React. They famously switched over to JSX to include templating inside
  the actual javascript files. As best I can tell and remember
  <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html"
    >this happened around 2013-2014</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Despite React saying explicitly in its introductory explanation of JSX that
  JSX is not HTML, most people took for granted how important this distinction
  was, and continue to do so. JSX is an abstraction that represents components
  and elements using XML-like syntax. Because you can freely call components or
  regular web elements in the XML you write, this produced a whole generation of
  developers that didn't need to distinguish between the abstraction and the
  platform API for DOM.
</p>

<p>I'm pretty certain that as people got used to seeing this:</p>

<code-highlight lang="typescript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function RenderSomeHTML() {
        return <p attribute="value"></p>;
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  They forgot completely about the JSX pragma and desugaring that was happening
  under the hood:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="typescript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function RenderSomeHTML() {
        return React.createElement("p", { attribute: "value" }, null);
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  JSX is a shorthand for creating a <em>representation</em> of a DOM tree. It is
  not HTML or a DOM tree itself.
</p>

<p>
  The important thing here is that <code>attribute</code> above is actually a
  <em>property</em> and not an attribute, even though it looks like an attribtue
  in JSX. And what confuses things further is that that property could be a
  valid attribute <em>eventually</em> when the element is rendered by React if
  React recognizes that property is actually a valid HTML attribute.
</p>

<p>
  This is not specific to React, though, because in every other javascript
  framework that has declarative templates you have the same issue. The template
  is a representation of the DOM tree you want the framework to eventually
  render, and so bindings <strong>could be either:</strong> a property at
  runtime that never translates into an attribute in the DOM
  <strong>or</strong> a property that is recognized as a valid HTML attribute
  and eventually placed in the DOM as such.
</p>

<h2>So why are they conflated in Lit?</h2>

<p>
  I think this is easily seen in how decorators are used to automatically set up
  attribute bindings in the background. In Lit, you can add a decorator, and
  magically the field you're defining on this class has an attribute
  automatically set up for that particular property on the custom element
</p>

<code-highlight lang="typescript">
  <template>
    <script>
      class MyElement extends LitElement {
        @property()
        myProperty = "foo";
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  Under the hood, Lit makes <code>this.myProperty</code> reactive to changes if
  set directly. It <em>also</em> deduces a corresponding attribute (in this case
  <code>myproperty</code> because it doesn't try to guess what the kebab casing
  would be) and sets up reactivity so that if the attribute changes in the DOM,
  the property changes as well.
</p>

<p>
  This is a <em>great</em> convenience for users of Lit. But it also can mislead
  people to think that there is an inherent binding between properties on a
  class and the attributes in the DOM. Of course there isn't a binding like this
  automatically. Lit just does it for you.
</p>

<p>
  To be fair, Lit also is very explicit about the distinction between attributes
  and properties. In
  <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/templates/expressions/"
    >lit-html template bindings</a
  >
  you have to specify when you're passing a property binding or an attribue:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="html">
  <template>
    <my-component
      .property="${thing}"
      attribute="string-thing"
      ?boolean="${bool}"
    ></my-component>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  <strong>But again this is not HTML!</strong> This is the template language
  abstraction for elements in
  <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/">lit-html</a> In
  HTML you must use attributes with plain strings or use good 'ol scripts:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="html">
  <template>
    <my-component attribute="string-thing"></my-component>
    <script>
      const myComponentEl = document.querySelector("my-component");
      myComponentEl.property = thing;
      myComponentEl.boolean = bool;
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<h2>My Law for Learning</h2>

<p>
  I have an aphorism of sorts I like to live by, and I think it's sound advice
  for anyone learning and developing their craft in coding:
</p>

<aside class="blue no-decoration">
  <p>
    A software engineer should understand at least one level below the
    abstraction level they primarily work in.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  This is not "grumpy ol' neckbeard who's upset that kids these days can't do
  vanilla javascript" advice. This is "I've learned over time that this helps me
  be a better developer" advice. Here's what working with vanilla javascript can
  unlock if you work in a framework:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Poking around at the internals of the framework set you up to better
    contribute to open source
  </li>
  <li>
    Understanding what's happening under the hood allows you to know almost
    immediately what can and cannot be the source of bugs you encounter
  </li>
  <li>
    Understanding internals frees you to take advantage of escape hatches built
    into frameworks (and when to actually use them!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Understanding internals allows you to know when the problem is framework
    problem or an inherent problem in general
  </li>
  <li>Poking at internals or re-creating framework things is fun</li>
  <li>
    Internals teach you what's actually available in browser APIs or in
    Javascript already
  </li>
  <li>
    Understanding low level docs (like the
    <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">ECMAscript spec</a> or internal specs on
    MDN) is an extremely transferrable skill and allows you to transfer to other
    frameworks and languages more easily
  </li>
  <li>
    You are able to optimize only the things you understand, and so you are
    better able to optimize operations in a framework
  </li>
</ul>
