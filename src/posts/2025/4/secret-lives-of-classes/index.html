<h1>
  The Secret Lives of Classes: A deep dive into javascript prototypes and
  classes
</h1>

<p class="post-details">Published {% prettyDate date %}, {% readTime page %}</p>

<p>
  You can be a succesful dev in javascript land and not think about prototypes
  much at all. They are a quaint relic, an oddball basis for the pet scripting
  language
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Creation_at_Netscape"
    >written in a week for Netscape</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  As I spend time working on architectural and library-based applications in
  browser-land I find that prototypes and their advantages are being completely
  forgotten. Typescript has nudged the great masses of javascript developers
  into the habit of using a <code>class</code>. And unless you've been coding
  for more than 8 or 9 years, you may have not known that classes were added
  late to the language, and there was... <em>something else</em> that allowed
  people to encapsulate data, create multiple similar instances, and provide
  structures that could abstract your code.
</p>

<p>
  I think this is a shame. I wonder often what life would be like if we stuck
  with prototypes and didn't get bullied into copying Java. Perhaps that alone
  would be a good post to write about.
</p>

<p>
  My thesis in this post is that prototypical programming is dead. And it's so
  dead that specifications and the way the browser implements classes is making
  prototypes not even all the helpful to understand.
</p>

  <p>
    I'll be using "Javascript" mostly, but it's important to note that the term
    is technically not the name of the language. Since Oracle holds the
    trademark for "Javascript," our language is actually called "ECMAscript."
    For all intents and purposes these are interchangeable, and
    <a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle"
      >I hope Oracle will drop the trademark</a
    >, but
    <a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle3"
      >it looks like Oracle is a soulless legal team mascarading as a technology
      company</a

<h2>Okay, let's talk about prototypes</h2>

<p>
  For the uninitiated, javascript was written with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"
    >prototypical inheritance</a
  >
  at its core. Instead of making a special template "cookie cutter" thing called
  a class, you would actually just use other objects as a template to re-use
  functionality.
</p>

<p>
  It's quite brilliant, if you think about it. Why make a special entity apart
  from objects? If you want a whole class of objects to have the same behavior,
  point them to a single object called their "prototype." If you try to use a
  method on the original object and the object doesn't have that method, it will
  look at its prototype to see if <em>that</em> object has it, and if that one
  doesn't, it will look at <em>its</em> prototype, and so on, until the method
  is found. If it isn't, we get <code>undefined</code> back, because, well, that
  thing was never defined in the prototype chain.
</p>

<p>Here's an example where we make a Cat "class" using prototypes only.</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      const catProto = {
        speak() {
          console.log("Meow");
        },
        scratch() {
          console.log("Scratches couch");
        },
      };

      let cat = { name: "Buford" };

      Object.setPrototypeOf(cat, catProto); // Where the magic happens!

      cat.name; // "Buford"
      cat.speak(); // logs "Meow", becuase it finds this method on the prototype
      cat.scratch(); // "Scratches couch"
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  This is extremely flexible, because you can more easily compose behavior. Want
  your objects to do X? Put X on its prototype object. Easy.
</p>

<p>
  This also did something very nice regarding inheritance. You could avoid the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance"
    >diamond problem</a
  >
  pretty easily by just being smart about mixing and creating your prototype
  objects.
</p>

<p>
  Don't want to have to manually create a new object for every instance?
  Javascript had you covered. Every function is actually a constructor. If you
  attached a prototype to that function, you had yourselve a constructor with a
  prototype already attached to any instance you created.
</p>

<p>
  So, normally for the "cat" example above, you probably would have this
  instead:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function Cat(name) {
        // This is the constructor, and `this` is a reference to the
        // new object (instance) you're creating when you use "new"
        this.name = name;
      }

      Cat.prototype = {
        speak() {
          console.log("Meow");
        },
        scratch() {
          console.log("Scratches couch");
        },
      };

      const buford = new Cat("Buford");

      buford.name; // "Buford"
      buford.speak(); // logs "Meow", becuase it finds this method on the prototype
      buford.scratch(); // "Scratches couch"
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  This is where Javascript's distinctive <code>this</code> comes in.
  <code>this</code> is someting so uniquely javascript, that also could probably
  be its own blog post. For this discussion, it's important to note that
  <code>this</code> exists because when you're writing prototypes you need a way
  to reference whatever object you're ending up on. And with Javascript, the
  context of where functions are called changes all the time.
</p>

<p>
  Why is this flexible? Well, if you want to share functionality, you just "mix
  it in."
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function Cat(name) {}

      Cat.prototype = {
        speak() {
          console.log("Meow");
        },
      };

      function Dog(name) {}

      Dog.prototype = {
        speak() {
          console.log("Roof");
        },
      };

      // NEW functionality dogs and cats should have
      const shedding = {
        shed() {
          console.log("This animal sheds a bunch of fur");
        },
      };

      Object.assign(Cat.prototype, shedding);
      Object.assign(Dog.prototype, shedding);

      // yay, they both shed now
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<h2>Typescript enters the chat</h2>

<p>
  There were many that weren't so happy with prototypes alone. This is
  understandable, because with the power of prototypical inheritance and mixing
  prototypes came great responsibility. It's hard to ensure that methods are on
  an object or its prototype chain if they could change at any moment at
  runtime.
</p>

<p>
  One way to make this process a bit streamlined is to use classes. The way
  they're presented makes them seem like their behavior is set in stone and
  reliable. And this is very true in other languages that use class inheritance.
  So Typescript creates classes that transpile into javascript.
</p>

<p>
  This is how it started: classes are just "syntactic sugar." You can write
  classes, and out comes typescript prototypes.
</p>

<p>Here is a class in Typescript...</p>

<code-highlight lang="typescript">
  <template>
    <script>
      class Greeter {
        name = "default";

        constructor(nameArg: string) {
          this.name = nameArg;
        }
        sayHi() {
          console.log("Hi, name")
        }
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>And here's how that's desugared into ES5...</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      "use strict";
      var Greeter = /** @class */ (function () {
        function Greeter(nameArg) {
          this.name = "default";
          this.name = nameArg;
        }
        Greeter.prototype.sayHi = function () {
          console.log("Hi, name");
        };
        return Greeter;
      })();
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<aside class="blue">
  <p>
    About "ES5" and "ES6": Along with typescript adopting usage of classes,
    ECMAscript had written the next specifications that included classes. This
    was called "ES6." It seems this is the diving line between pre-class and
    post-class almost everything, because when tools like typescript "target
    ES5," that means that any transpiling that happens must account for the spec
    of ES5 and that means no classes, only prototypes.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, when MDN talks about how something is not possible in "pre-ES6" code,
    this means that it literally cannot be even transpiled to ES5 or earlier
    because the spec did not support the functionality at all. More on that
    later.
  </p>
</aside>

<h2>It's not as simple as "just syntactic sugar" anymore</h2>

<p>
  As more and more features are added to javascript, it's harder and harder to
  maintain simple transpilation.
</p>

<p>
  Decorators were added to Typescript in version 1.5 in 2015, and ever since
  then you can enable them with the <code>--experimentalDecorators</code> flag,
  even though today they're a totally legit typescript feature that's in no way
  unstable.
</p>

<p>
  They are still called "experimental" because there are competitors... kind of.
  Decorators have also been talked about in various forms in babel transpilation
  and natively in TC39 proposals. To support all these variations and new
  features being written into future spec proposals very smart people had to
  start making adjustments to how things in a class are transpiled.
</p>

<p>
  In Typescript 3.7, the folks at Microsoft wrote an
  <a
    href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier"
    >interesting explanation</a
  >
  of why they were changing how class profields were transpiled.
</p>

<p>
  In a nutshell, this is how Typescript (and many others) thought class fields
  would transpile:
</p>

<code-highlight>
  <template>
    <script>
      class Foo {
        field = "Default value";
        uninitializedField;
      }

      // Transpiles to

      function Foo() {
        this.field = "Default value";
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>When in reality, this is what needs to get transpiled</p>

<code-highlight>
  <template>
    <script>
      class Foo {
        field = "Default value";
        uninitializedField;
      }

      // Transpiles to

      class Foo {
        constructor() {
          Object.defineProperty(this, "field", {
            enumerable: true,
            configurable: true,
            writable: true,
            value: 100,
          });
          Object.defineProperty(this, "uninitializedField", {
            enumerable: true,
            configurable: true,
            writable: true,
            value: void 0,
          });
        }
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  I actually can't tell you exactly why... but this is not the expected
  behavior, at least, not if this were simple desugaring of prototypes. There is
  something extra going on to accomodate classes. I think this mostly is a way
  to define properties on the class that have an undefined value (the
  <code>uninitializedField</code>.)
</p>

<p>
  What's interesting is that today-
  <strong
    >this is how fields are initialized natively in the browser when using
    classes.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  That's right, if you use a field in plain ol' javascript in the browser, it's
  actually applied to the constructed instance using defineProperty.
</p>

<h3>That's really specific</h3>

<p>
  Why does that matter? Well, I ran into this error while working on my
  <a href="https://github.com/JimSchofield/minne">Minne</a> library:
</p>

{% include "./example1.html" %}

<p>You will see this error in the console</p>

<img
  src="./error-example.png"
  alt="An error in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: someProp"
/>

<p>
  It turns out that browsers interpret and run field initializers using
  basically <code>Object.defineProperty</code> under the hood. When I try to run
  my method for Minne, I'm also using the same method to set properties with
  special functionality. It conflicts!
</p>

<p>
  The solution is to run my Minne method in the constructor only... which is
  fine, but not as nice for the consumer. That means some fields are field
  definitions on the class, and some might be in the constructor.
</p>

{% include "./example2.html" %}

<p>
  This isn't just my problem though. If you look at the Lit documentation,
  <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/components/decorators/#decorators-typescript"
    >they run into this same issue</a
  >
  for intializing values on class fields
</p>

<p>
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields#:~:text=Because%20class%20fields%20are%20added%20using%20the"
    >MDN explains how this is so under the hood</a
  >, which leads to some unexpected behavior with invoking setters on a base
  class.
</p>

<p><strong>So here's a TLDR of this class fields thing:</strong></p>

<p>
  Browsers are making native behavior with javascript classes that are not
  intuitively mapped to javascript prototypes. If you were to be writing a
  javascript prototype of the examples above, I think you would be
  <em>very surprised</em> by the <code>defineProperty</code> native behavior.
</p>

<p>
  I think for better or worse classes are the main entity now for abstractions
  and reuse, so the behavior under the hood does not have to be expected or
  consistent with prior prototype patterns.
</p>

<h3>Another example: making a custom element</h3>

<p>Have you tried to make a custom element with just Javascript prototypes?</p>

<p>
  First off, we need to talk about how to subclass with prototypes, because to
  make a custom element you are required to extend <code>HTMLElement</code>, and
  you must call `super()` in the constructor.
</p>

<p>
  Let's say that you have a Base prototype - Animal, and you want to extend off
  of that prototype. Let's make a Cat. First, what it looks like with classes.
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      class Animal {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }

        eat() {
          console.log(this.name + " eats");
        }
      }

      class Cat extends Animal {
        constructor(name, color) {
          super(name);

          this.color = color;
        }

        groom() {
          console.log(this.name + " grooms its " + this.color + " fur");
        }
      }

      const larry = new Cat("larry", "orange");

      larry.eat(); // "Larry eats"
      larry.groom(); // "Larry grooms its orange fur"

      larry instanceof Cat; // true
      larry instanceof Animal; // true,
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  Okay, fair enough. Now let's see what you need to do with prototypes.
  Conceivably, classes are just shorthand for the following:
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function Animal(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      Animal.prototype.eat = function () {
        console.log(this.name + " eats");
      };

      function Cat(name, color) {
        // We need to instantiate the Animal base of our cat
        // This is basically calling `super()`
        Animal.call(this, name);

        this.color = color;
      }

      // Also, we need to make sure the Cat prototype starts out
      // as an instance of the Animal prototype, since it inherits
      // everything about Animal
      Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

      // And we need to set the constructor this object would be made with
      // which is Cat itself
      Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat;

      Cat.prototype.groom = function () {
        console.log(this.name + " grooms its " + this.color + " fur");
      };

      const larry = new Cat("larry", "orange");

      larry.eat(); // "Larry eats"
      larry.groom(); // "Larry grooms its orange fur"

      larry instanceof Cat; // true
      larry instanceof Animal; // true,
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  Okay, so lots of code. And this prototype thing can be confusing if you're not
  used to it. I can see why people wanted to retreat to classes.
</p>

<p>
  Now, let's try to make a custom element in prototype land. You do the exact
  same process as above...
</p>

{% include "./example3.html" %}

<p>We run into an error:</p>

<aside class="error">
  <p>
    Failed to construct 'HTMLElement': Please use the 'new' operator, this DOM
    object constructor cannot be called as a function.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>What the heck? HTMLElement can't be called like any other function?</p>

<p>
  It turns out that you can't. There are some "Functions" or classes like
  <code>HTMLElement</code> that you can't call directly. When you try to
  subclass with a prototype, and you call <code>HTMLElement.apply(this)</code>,
  you run into an issue where the constructor function can't be called. If you
  try to use <code>new</code> and spin up a new <code>HTMLElement</code> like
  the error suggest, you get a different error
</p>

<aside class="error">
  <p>
    Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'HTMLElement': Illegal constructor
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  So what is a web component connoisseur like us supposed to do if we want to do
  it with ES5, pre-class, prototypes? It turns out it's
  <strong>not possible</strong> in strictly ES5.
</p>

<h4>The need for <code>Reflect.construct</code></h4>

<p>
  What we need is a way to "extend" our prototype by constructing a new
  sub-class instance while maintaining the prototype link of the base class.
  This is actually
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target#new.target_using_reflect.construct:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20due%20to%20the%20lack%20of"
    >just not possible pre-es6</a
  >
</p>

<p>
  What we need is a new feature housed in the <code>Reflect</code> API which was
  included in ES6 and finalized in 2015
</p>

<p>
  <code>Reflect.construct</code> Is basically <em>the function</em> that
  performs <code>new</code>, and effectively allows us to do
  <code>super()</code>. This is perfect for classes, because that's what
  <code>extends</code> and <code>constructor()</code> do.
</p>

<code-highlight lang="javascript">
  <template>
    <script>
      function Base() {}

      function A(...args) {
        Base.apply(this, ...args);
      }

      // Is functionally the same as

      function A(...args) {
        return Reflect.construct(Base, args, A);
      }
    </script>
  </template>
</code-highlight>

<p>
  This is how we get around that issue of using HTMLElement as a function. This
  is how we "call super" with prototypes. This is how we can extend
  <code>HTMLElement</code> for custom elements.
</p>

{% include "./example4.html" %}

<aside>
  <p>
    By the way, this isn't the only place where
    <code>Reflect.construct</code> is required to extend what's called
    "built-ins". The same happens for <code>Error</code> and
    <code>Array</code> and <code>Map</code>(see the warning MDN provides here
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#:~:text=Builtin%20subclassing%20cannot%20be%20reliably%20transpiled"
      >here</a
    >).
  </p>

<h2>Class internals aren't what they used to be</h2>

<p>So what am I trying to say? We're well past the world of prototypes.</p>

<p>
  If we're well past prototypes and not willing to risk using prototypes for
  fear of their dangers, I'm wondering if it's important <em>at all</em> that
  people dig into prototype intracacies. We can understand everything in terms
  of classes. I've always heard "it's good to learn about to understand what
  goes on under the hood" but it's actually way more confusing to look under the
  hood, and trying to model classes using prototypes is complicated. Why not
  just live in the world of that extra type abstraction of classes?
</p>

<p>
  I asked someone to explain the difference between javascript class inheritance
  and java class inheritance, and they couldn't actually say that anything was
  different <em>except</em> that javascript has this prototype primitive that
  can be changed at run time, and Java class inheritance can't be changed at run
  time. Otherwise, for all intents and purposes, the inheritances, the methods,
  the class fields, behave nearly identically to other languages.
</p>

<p>
  On a personal note, this makes me a little sad. The one distinct feature of
  javascript was this experimental mode of inheritance that allowed exceptional
  flexibility at runtime. I don't think we truly found the benefits of this
  extra flexibility, and most people just complained about its unfamiliarity
  instead of learning to use prototypes correctly. And now it's been eclipsed by
  a lumbering abstraction used by all the "big boy" languages.
</p>

<p>
  This matters in a world where javascript is (practically and really) the only
  language for web apps
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Oh well. There's always Rust. And maybe someday we can compile to web
  assembly?
</p>

<br />

<p>
  I had to do a lot of research for this post and I probably made some mistakes.
  Let me know. {% socials %}
