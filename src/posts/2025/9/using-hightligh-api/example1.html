        Cats are intriguing animals that make excellent pets. Their
        independence, grace, and intelligence allow them to adapt to any living
        situation.
        <mark
          >Furthermore, their ability to maintain themselves and hunt makes them
          low-maintenance and practical companions</mark
        >. Unlike dogs, who sometimes want continual attention and care from
        their owners, cats are satisfied to do their own thing and enjoy the
        company of their own. They have an inherent feeling of independence that
        distinguishes them from other tamed animals. Furthermore, their slim and
        nimble bodies move with elegance and beauty that no other animal can
        match. They are natural born athletes, and it is a thrill to watch them
        leap, pounce, and play.
